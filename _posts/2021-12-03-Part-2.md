### Political Ideology & Education Funding

#### Overview

Over this past year, states and local governments have begun a one-a-decade process of drawing new voting district boundaries. This redistricting uses population and demographic data from the census conducted by the Census Bureau, with the most recent occurring in 2020.

Yet, redistricting has become the most pressing threat to democracy. 

Alongside a [2019 Supreme Court](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/court-cases/rucho-v-common-cause)  ruling that
**prohibits redistricting to be challenged in federal court**, this reaffirms major threats to health, education, and social safety net policies at state and national levels, even moreso heightened midst a time of deep divisive partisanship in the United States.

#### In summary, this is major pressing challenge to education because
- Rigged maps **make elections less competitive**, severly dampening the voices and political voices of all Americans

- Both historical and current residential segregation means that **marginalized communities are the targets of pointed redistricting**; effectively creating a tool for parties to slice and dice districts in ways that discriminate against communities of color

- **Gerrymandering is getting worse.** Applying data science to work, intricate computer algorithms and sophisticated date on voter patterns have allowed political gamesmanship to "maximize" partisan benefit

### Initial Questions

As a part of a larger exploration, we apply the SEDA data set to provide a comprehensive picture of factors at the household, district, and state-level factors that we hypothesize influence student educational outcomes. 

In Part I Machine Learning model, *Congressional District* was found to be an important predictor of academic achievement.

In this next analyses, we look at how the dominant constituent ideology (right-leaning or conservative vs. left-leaning or liberal) is potentially associated with congressional district expenditure:

1. Per pupil, and;
2. Per instructor 

> #### Specifically, does spending on school districts differ by political ideology?

### Analyses

As shown, we do find spatial correlations in political preferences. Politically right Congressional districts are clustered in the Midwest and South, and politically left Congressional districts tend to be located on the coasts.

In addition to, we find that the extent to which these districts are right- or left-leaning is not balanced. Districts that are more conservative (or right-leaning), on average, are much greater than liberal (or left-leaning) Districts. In other words, conservative Districts tend to be much more radically so than liberal Districts.

In addition, we find that the magnitude to which these districts are right- or left-leaning is not balanced. Districts that are more conservative (or right-leaning), on average, are much greater than liberal (or left-leaning) Districts. In other words, conservative Districts tend to be much more radically so than liberal Districts./

*Now, how does this relate to spending on education?*

A layered histogram will suffice. From this we can explore: 

1. How much is invested in students and teachers, scaled using the underlying dispersion of values (in units of standard deviation)

2. How clustered is the spending? i.e. plot skew and spread

From the histogram, we find that, indeed, confirms our hypothesis: 

**that, as expected from party platforms positions, more conservative districts invest less in students and teachers.**

Further: 

- The mean spending is different between districts, with districts that are more left-leaning, on average, investing more in students and teachers.

- In addition, the distribution of spending is less ‘bunched’ in liberal Districts a right skew (meaning there are more districts that spend above the national average in students and teachers).\

Now, let's merge Congressional district boundaries and education spending together in a single visualization.

### Interactive Analyses

An interactive map facilitates this comparison by grouping dominant political preferences and expenditure per student and teacher averaged over school districts in a Congressional District. 

Please toggle between right- and left-leaning congressional districts. The darker the green color, the higher the congressional district is ranked in expenditure per pupil and per instructor.

### Findings

As mentioned in class, 

> Plots of maps can be very powerful, very informative and very aesthetically pleasing visualizations.

The goal was to be able to provide a compelling story using nationally representative data. 

All in all, we hope that this work underscores the potential impact of gerrymandering on students and teachers by visualizing differences in spending in education for grades 3-8 based on the dominant political ideology in Congressional districts.

It is clear, that investing in students and teachers to ensure that all can access the support needed is critical for equity in education. We find that despite that the for right-leaning Districts, the magnitude in which constituent preferences are predominantly sided is much greater than for left-leaning Districts. In other words, Districts that are more left-leaning, are less radically liberal (and more neutral) than right-leaning Districts are radically conservative.

Yet, left-leaning districts invest more on average in students and teachers, with the leading Districts left-leaning. Further, follow up analyses may want to look at other outcomes, such as student teacher ratio and proportions of special education students, English language learners, special education teachers, and guidance counselors in school districts between Congressional Districts.

### What's Next?
#### Here's how you can help

1. Make sure to register to vote in local, state, and national elections! Your votes *do* matter, even if hyper-gerrymandering is challenging fairness is representation

2. Write to your representatives! Phone calls, emails, snail mail... all are great options to express your opinion and to demonstrate what issues matter to you. 
To find out who your representative is, visit [here for all U.S. states](https://www.commoncause.org/find-your-representative/) or [here for Massachusetts specifically](https://malegislature.gov/search/findmylegislator)

3. Support students. This includes making sure you're aware of how charter, private, and magnet schools attract an influx of higher-income families to specific neighborhoods, potentially disadvantaging and displacing others.
