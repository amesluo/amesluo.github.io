### Predicting District Academic Acheivement

#### Overview

In **Part 1**, we use the Stanford Education Data Archive to analyze student achievement based on school district predictors. To do such, we approach predictors of academic acheivement in three seperate ways: 
<br>
 
1. **Machine learning model** to determine key predictors that explain most of the variation in educational acheivement.
2. **Association/Correlation** between socioeconomic factors, including unemployment, poverty indexes, SES composite scores, and academic acheivement, applied to case study states of Massachusetts, Washington, Nebraska, and California.
3. **Regression** of percent free or reduced school lunch on academic acheivement with SES composite score and geography as covariates.
4. **Interactive regression**, created using Shiny, to select predictors and visualize how they map to academic acheivement.

### Initial Questions


- What are some of the most important predictors of academic achievement at the national level?
- How is unemployment, poverty, and socioeconomic status associated with academic achievement in Massachusetts, Washington, Nebraska, and California? 
- How is percent free or reduced lunch associated with academic achievement in districts at the national level? 

### Data Sources

**School Expenditure data** are available from: [https://exhibits.stanford.edu/data/catalog/db586ns4974](https://exhibits.stanford.edu/data/catalog/db586ns4974)

### Analyses

In Part I Machine Learning model, percent free or reduced lunch was found to be an important predictor of academic achievement. From the scatterplot below, we can see that there is a **clear relationship between percent free or reduced lunch and academic achievement**. 

Districts with a higher percentage of free or reduced lunch had lower academic achievement rates. Perhaps this is because free lunch is highly correlated with income. Lower income districts have higher poverty rates and therefore higher rates of food-assistance programs. Lower income districts also have fewer academic resources and less investment in education, which contributes to lower academic achievement rates.

However, there are many factors that affect the relationship between academic achievement and percent free or reduced lunch, for example, geographic location (urban vs. rural) and socioeconomic status. Both of these factors highly influence food and education quality and accessibility. 

Hence, we include both of these variables as covariates in our regression model of percent free or reduced lunch on academic achievement, shown below.

From Model 1, we can see that our main predictor (percent free or reduced lunch) as well as the other two covariates (socioeconomic status and geography) have a statistically significant relationship with the outcome variable (academic achievement) at a 5% significance level. Nevertheless, this model assumes that the effect of any individual predictor (percent free or reduced lunch, SES, geography) on the outcome (academic achievement) is independent of the other predictors in the model. This may not be a reasonable assumption given that percent free or reduced lunch may have a different effect on academic achievement based on different values of socioeconomic status and urban versus rural settings. 

As a result, we include a second model, Model 2, including interaction terms, which are both statistically significant. This suggests that the **effect of percent free or reduced lunch on academic achievement is different for urban versus rural districts as well as for different values of socioeconomic status.**

#### Findings

As seen in the the regression output above and the graphs below, The relationship between percent free or reduced lunch and academic achievement is different for districts in rural versus urban areas as well as for different values of socioeconomic status.

</p>


From the graph we can see that the slope for urban areas is slightly steeper than that of rural areas **meaning that the effect of percent free or reduced lunch on academic achievement in districts is greater in urban areas than rural areas**. Moreover, the relationship between percent free or reduced lunch and academic achievement changes more rapidly in urban areas than in rural areas.

We can also see that the relationship varies for different categories of socioeconomic status, especially for districts that are at the extremes (2.5 standard deviation units above and 2.5 standard deviation units below the average national socioeconomic status). The relationship between percent free or reduced lunch and academic outcomes is positive for districts that are 2.5 standard deviation units above whereas for all other socioeconomic status categories the relationship is negative. 

However, there are several factors besides the one considered in this analysis that may affect academic achievement such as parental educational background, parenting style, parental occupation, financial security in a household, and the quality of food in a school. Hence, a limitation to this analysis is that it does not explore how these other relevant factors may affect the relationship between academic achievement and percent free or reduced lunch at different levels of SES and urban versus rural settings. Free or reduced lunch programs also vary by state in terms eligibility and quality of food, which is an important difference that is not considered in this analysis. 

All in all, the relationship between academic achievement and percent free or reduced lunch is highly complex and nuanced, with several observable and unobservable factors affecting how food assistance policies influence academic achievement outcomes in districts. **These analyses data are indicators of that the relationship between academic achievement and percent free or reduced lunch differs significantly in urban versus rural districts and in different levels of socioeconomic status.**
