## Defining Impacts

We produced a visualization tool using RShiny in order to make changing visualizations of the relationship between changing independent variables and our outcome of interest: standardizd average district achievement scores. We also wanted to be able to visualize these relationships while adjusting for the other covariates in order to see which relationships persist and which are less influential after adjusting for covariates. We do this using the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem, and visualize the residuals from two regression models (this is described in greater detail on the Shiny App page). 

Overall, many of the relationships are persistent after adjusting; however, some of them do change as we can see in the images below:

If we look at the unadjusted relationship between the percentage of students receiving free/reduced lunch, we see a strong linear negative relationship between higher percentages of free lunch and district achievement scores.

After adjusting and visualizing the relationship in the residualized plots. We can see that this relationship is persistent although its decreased in magnitude slightly. 

However, this isn't true for every varaible.

When looking at the relationship between the percent of households receiving SNAP benefits and district achievement scores before and after adjusting for the other covariates, we see that much of the variation is explained away. This may be that percent of households receiving SNAP benefits is highly correlated with students receiving free or reduced lunch, and as such, after adjusting for each other, the variation in dristrict achievement scores is explained away.

We also see this effect in the covariate for female labor force participation as seen below:

</p>

What looks like a moderate positive relationship between female labor force participation and district achievement becomes much flatter after adjusting for the other covariates. This may be that it's highly correlated with socioeconomic status. 

It's important to note, however, this is from just a handful of selected district variables, and as we've highlighted throughout our analyses, district test score performance is multifaceted. As such, further research is required to identify causal relationships between these covariates of interest and test score performance, and evaluations of policies that address these potential levers are needed.
