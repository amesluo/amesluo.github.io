### Predicting District Academic Acheivement

#### Overview
In **Part 1**, we use the Stanford Education Data Archive to analyze student achievement based on school district predictors. To do such, we approach predictors of academic acheivement in three seperate ways: 
<br>
 
1. **Machine learning model** to determine key predictors that explain most of the variation in educational acheivement.
2. **Association** between socioeconomic status, unemployment, and poverty indexes and academic acheivement, and applied to case study states of Washington and Massachusetts.
3. **Regression** of receipt of free school lunches on academic acheivement.
