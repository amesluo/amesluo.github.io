### Shiny App 

We produced a Shiny App for visualizing linear relationships between some of our covariates of interest from our research and the average district achievement scores.
We also provide the ability to adjust these relationships for the 10 of the other covariates included in our analysis to identify, which of these relationships may persist
after adjusting for relevant covariates.

The Shiny App incorporating how it was built and a description are included here:
