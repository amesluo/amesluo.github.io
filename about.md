Hey there! These analyses were created for BST 260 Final Project, Fall 2021, by members Han Choi, Yeeun Lee, Amy Luo, Juliet McCann, and Austin Tucker! 

#### About our Team

We are all students at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in the Department of Global Health & Population 

##### Some fun facts about us: 

- One of us is from Guatemala
- Two of us are from California (Bay Area & LA)
- Two of us are East Coast natives, where we all go to school now
- All of us love potatoes (waffle fries being the *best* way to eat 'em!)
