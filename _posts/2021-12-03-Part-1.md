### Predicting District Academic Acheivement

#### Overview

In **Part 1**, we use the Stanford Education Data Archive to analyze student achievement based on school district predictors. To do such, we approach predictors of academic acheivement in three seperate ways: 
<br>
 
1. **Machine learning model** to determine key predictors that explain most of the variation in educational acheivement.
2. **Association/Correlation** between socioeconomic factors, including unemployment, poverty indexes, SES composite scores, and academic acheivement, applied to case study states of Massachusetts, Washington, Nebraska, and California.
3. **Regression** of percent free or reduced school lunch on academic acheivement with SES composite score and geography as covariates.
4. **Interactive regression**, created using Shiny, to select predictors and visualize how they map to academic acheivement.

### Initial Questions


- What are some of the most important predictors of academic achievement at the national level?
- How is unemployment, poverty, and socioeconomic status associated with academic achievement in Massachusetts, Washington, Nebraska, and California? 
- How is percent free or reduced lunch associated with academic achievement in districts at the national level? 

### Data Sources

For this protion of the project, we use the SEDA dataset that maps student achievement based on different district level covariates. The [Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford University](https://edopportunity.org/) measures educational opportunity in diverse communities all over America. We downloaded the files from the publicly available datasets that the SEDA project has online [here](https://exhibits.stanford.edu/data/catalog/db586ns4974). 

For information on academic achievement, we downloaded `seda_geodist_pool_cs_4.0.dta`, which includes geographic school district achievement estimates. In this dataset, achievement estimates use a cohort standardized (CS) scale based on the cohort that was in the 4th grade in Spring 2009. This CS metric scales district standardizes test performance so that the scores represent the standard deviations away from the national grade-subject-specific performance of this single cohort. For our analysis, we will be specifically using the variable `cs_mn_avg_ol` to measure district academic achievement. This variable measures the mean district performance on Math/Reading standardized tests using an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimate and is reported on the CS scale (in standard deviations away from the national average). 

Therefore, a district with a `cs_mn_avg_ol` score of zero is performing in line with the average district performance at the national level. On the other hand, a district with a `cs_mn_avg_ol` score of -1 is performing 1 standard deviation below the national average while a district with a `cs_mn_avg_ol` score of + 1 is peforming 1 standard deviation above.

For data on the covariates that we will be using to predict academic achievement in this analysis, we downloaded `seda_cov_geodist_pool_4.0.dta`. This dataset includes over 50 variables illustrating the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the districts in the United States. These covariates will be further described below.

#### Exploring the relative improtance of our covartiates in predicting District Academic Achievment

We began anysis with some intial explorotory data anylysis about variation of academic achievement between districts in the United States. From the Box Plot below, we notice there is substantial variation in test scores both between and within states. Districts in Massachusetts have the highest median test score, performing at about 0.5 standard deviaitons above the national average. On the other hand, the lowest median academic achievement scores (excluding DC) can be found in New Medico, where the median score is about 0.4 standard deviations below national average. With that being said, a lot of the national variation in academic performance appears to be coming from variation within states. For example, in many states, such as California, you can find districts with both extremely high and extremely low test scores.

In our analysis, we hope to understand the factors that contribute to such variation in academic achievement between districts across the United States. The covariate dataset includes many potential predictors of district test scores. However, for the purpose of our project, we want to focus our analysis on a few key covariates in order to produce more focused and meaningful conclusions.

To decide on our covariates of foucus, we will combine explorotory data anlysis to visually estimate variables of importance with  a Random Forest Machine Learning to more robustly determine the relative importance of covariates to predict district academic achievement. Our final list of predictors from which we will be determining relative improtance are the following:

- `urban`: district is in a city/urban locale (binary; 0 = no, 1 = yes)
- `suburb`: district is in a suburban locale (binary; 0 = no, 1 = yes)
- `town`: district is in a town locale (binary; 0 = no, 1 = yes)
- `rural`: district is in a rural locale (binary; 0 = no, 1 = yes)
- `perind`: % Native American students in the district
- `perasn`: % Asian students in the district
- `perhsp`: % Hispanic students in the district
- `perblk`: % Black students in the district
- `perwht`: % White Students in the district
- `perfl`: % students receiving free lunch
- `perrl`: % students receiving reduced lunch
- `perfrl`: % students receiving free or reduced lunch
- `perecd`: % economically disadvantaged students in the district
- `perell`: % English Language Learners
- `perspeced`: % students who receive Special Education
- `totenrl`: # students in the grade 
- `sesavgall`: SES composite score 
- `lninc50all`: log of median income
- `baplusall`: % of adults in district with at least a bachelors degree (percentage)
- `povertyall`: poverty rate (%)
- `unempall`: unemployment rate (%)
- `snapall`: SNAP recipient rate (%)
- `single_momall`: % of household with children with single mom
- `ppexp_inst`: total per pupil expenditures on instruction (dollars)
- `pprev_tot`: revenue per pupil (dollars)

We can use plots to visualize the relationship with district academic achievement (`cs_mn_avg_ol`) and our or continuous predictors (`perind`, `perasn`, `perhsp`, `perblk`, `perwht`, `perfl`, `perrl`, `perfrl`, `perecd`, `perell`, `perspeced`, `totenrl`, `sesavgall`, `lninc50avgall`,`baplusavgall`, `povertyavgall`, `unempavgall`, `snapavgall`, `single_momavgall`, `ppexp_tot`, `ppexp_inst`).

[insert plots here]

For the binary predictors describing the town locale (`urban`, `suburb`, `town`, `rural`), we can use a box plot to compare district academic achievement:

[insert box plot of town locales here]

The above scatter plots and box plot confirm what we initially suspected: many of these variables do in fact appear to predict academic achievement. For example, it appears `baplusall`, the percent of adults in the district with at least a bachelor's degree, is quite positively correlated with academic achievement. On the other hand, the percent of households in poverty or with a single mother appear to be negatively correlated. For other variables, such as per pupil expenditure (`ppexpt_inst`), the association is less clear. Overall, while these scatter plots give us a general sense of what variables may be important, a Random Forest Model can help us determine the relative improtance of these predictors using more robust computations.

After executing a Random Forest model with the 25 variables listed above, the below ranking of the Gini Index Decrease was determined. The higher the Gini Index decrease for a variable, the more important that variable is for predicting district academic achievement.

[insert Gini ranking bar plot]

From the above ranking of relative predictive importance of the 25 variables, we can draw some conclusions that can inform our next analyses. First, variables describing the percentage of students receiving free or reduced lunch have high levels of importance for the Random Forest Model predicting district academic achievement. Second, socio-economic variables, including the percentage of students who are categorized as "economically disadvantaged" and the percent of adults with at least a Bachelor's degree, are some of the most important predictors of academic achievement. While not ranked in the top 5, socio-economic status (SES) composite score, poverty rate, and unemployment rate all still important predictors of a academic achievement and are variables of particular interest to our team.

Based on these analyses, our team then decided to explore more in depth the role of some of the socio-economic variables and free/reduced lunch in district academic achievement. 
 
In Part I Machine Learning model, percent free or reduced lunch was found to be an important predictor of academic achievement. From the scatterplot below, we can see that there is a **clear relationship between percent free or reduced lunch and academic achievement**. 

Districts with a higher percentage of free or reduced lunch had lower academic achievement rates. Perhaps this is because free lunch is highly correlated with income. Lower income districts have higher poverty rates and therefore higher rates of food-assistance programs. Lower income districts also have fewer academic resources and less investment in education, which contributes to lower academic achievement rates.

However, there are many factors that affect the relationship between academic achievement and percent free or reduced lunch, for example, geographic location (urban vs. rural) and socioeconomic status. Both of these factors highly influence food and education quality and accessibility. 

Hence, we include both of these variables as covariates in our regression model of percent free or reduced lunch on academic achievement, shown below. 


<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amesluo/amesluo.github.io/master/images/Regression%20Table.png">
</p>


From Model 1, we can see that our main predictor (percent free or reduced lunch) as well as the other two covariates (socioeconomic status and geography) have a statistically significant relationship with the outcome variable (academic achievement) at a 5% significance level. Nevertheless, this model assumes that the effect of any individual predictor (percent free or reduced lunch, SES, geography) on the outcome (academic achievement) is independent of the other predictors in the model. This may not be a reasonable assumption given that percent free or reduced lunch may have a different effect on academic achievement based on different values of socioeconomic status and urban versus rural settings. 

As a result, we include a second model, Model 2, including interaction terms, which are both statistically significant. This suggests that the **effect of percent free or reduced lunch on academic achievement is different for urban versus rural districts as well as for different values of socioeconomic status.**

#### Findings

As seen in the the regression output above and the graphs below, The relationship between percent free or reduced lunch and academic achievement is different for districts in rural versus urban areas as well as for different values of socioeconomic status.

    <img width="70%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amesluo/amesluo.github.io/master/images/Lunch_Geo_Final.png">
</p>


From the graph we can see that the slope for urban areas is slightly steeper than that of rural areas **meaning that the effect of percent free or reduced lunch on academic achievement in districts is greater in urban areas than rural areas**. Moreover, the relationship between percent free or reduced lunch and academic achievement changes more rapidly in urban areas than in rural areas. 

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="80%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amesluo/amesluo.github.io/master/images/Lunch_SES_Final.png">
</p>


We can also see that the relationship varies for different categories of socioeconomic status, especially for districts that are at the extremes (2.5 standard deviation units above and 2.5 standard deviation units below the average national socioeconomic status). The relationship between percent free or reduced lunch and academic outcomes is positive for districts that are 2.5 standard deviation units above whereas for all other socioeconomic status categories the relationship is negative. 

However, there are several factors besides the one considered in this analysis that may affect academic achievement such as parental educational background, parenting style, parental occupation, financial security in a household, and the quality of food in a school. Hence, a limitation to this analysis is that it does not explore how these other relevant factors may affect the relationship between academic achievement and percent free or reduced lunch at different levels of SES and urban versus rural settings. Free or reduced lunch programs also vary by state in terms eligibility and quality of food, which is an important difference that is not considered in this analysis. 

All in all, the relationship between academic achievement and percent free or reduced lunch is highly complex and nuanced, with several observable and unobservable factors affecting how food assistance policies influence academic achievement outcomes in districts. **These analyses data are indicators of that the relationship between academic achievement and percent free or reduced lunch differs significantly in urban versus rural districts and in different levels of socioeconomic status.**


#### Overall Conclusions of Part 1

In this section of the project, we aimed to explore some of the predictors of district academic performance in the United States and from our analyses we can draw the following conclusions. 

From our initial exploratory data analysis and Random Forest modeling, we determined certain socio-economic variables were particularly important for predicting academic achievement. The top two predictors for district academic achievement were the percent of students in the district who were economically disadvantaged and the percent of adults in the district with at least a Bachelor’s degree. Other important predictors included the percent of students receiving free or reduced lunch and other socio-economic variables such as SES, unemployment, and poverty.

We then further explored the role of unemployment, poverty, and SES in academic achievement. Here, we found that the relationships between unemployment and district academic achievement varied between states. For example, Massachusetts appeared to have a steeper relationship between unemployment and achievement when compared to states such as California, Nebraska, and Washington. 

Finally, when exploring the role of free or reduced lunch in predicting academic achievement, we found that this relationship varied between urban and rural districts and across different levels of socioeconomic status.
