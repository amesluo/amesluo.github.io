### Predicting District Academic Acheivement

#### Overview
In **Part 1**, we use the Stanford Education Data Archive to analyze student achievement based on school district predictors. To do such, we approach predictors of academic acheivement in three seperate ways: 
<br>
 
1. **Machine learning model** to determine key predictors that explain most of the variation in educational acheivement.
2. **Association/Correlation** between socioeconomic factors, including unemployment, poverty indexes, SES composite scores, and academic acheivement, applied to case study states of Massachusetts, Washington, Nebraska, and California.
3. **Regression** of percent free or reduced school lunch on academic acheivement with SES composite score and geography as covariates.
4. **Interactive regression**, created using Shiny, to select predictors and visualize how they map to academic acheivement.
